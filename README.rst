wagtail-inventory
=================

Search Wagtail pages by block type.

Wagtail Inventory adds the ability to search pages in your Wagtail site by the StreamField block types they contain. It adds a new Settings menu to the Wagtail admin site that allows you to search for pages that do or do not contain certain blocks. It supports searching both by Wagtail built-in blocks (like ``CharBlock``) as well as any custom blocks you might define.

Setup
-----

Install the package using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install wagtail-inventory
 
Add ``wagtailinventory`` as an installed app in your Django settings:

.. code-block:: python

  # in settings.py
  INSTALLED_APPS = (
      ...
      'wagtailinventory',
      ...
  )

Run migrations to create required database tables:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ manage.py migrate wagtailinventory

Run a management command to initialize database tables with current pages:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ manage.py block_inventory

You should now be able to search your pages in the Wagtail admin site, under Settings > Block Inventory.

Compatibility
-------------

This code has been tested for compatibility with:

* Python 3.6, 3.8
* Django 1.11, 2.2
* Wagtail 2.3, 2.9

It should be compatible with all intermediate versions, as well.
If you find that it is not, please `file an issue <https://github.com/cfpb/wagtail-inventory/issues/new>`_.

Testing
-------

Run unit tests with ``tox`` to test against select supported package combinations.
